# Parronaut Server

Welcome to the Parronaut Server, the backbone of our map routing application. This server is designed to provide efficient, real-time services for both passengers and drivers. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

## User Management Service

This service is responsible for handling user login and managing profiles for both passengers and drivers.

## Real-Time Navigation Service

Leveraging the power of Google Maps, this service provides routing and estimated times of arrival (ETAs) in real-time.

## Driver Monitoring Service

This service allows drivers to track passengers and stops, ensuring a smooth and efficient journey.

## Passenger Notification Service

Passengers are kept informed with alerts for approaching stops and arrival times, thanks to this service.

## Payment Integration Service

We've integrated payment processing directly into our application, making transactions seamless and straightforward.

## MongoDB

All our data is centrally managed with MongoDB, a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

## API Gateway

Our API Gateway manages client requests, ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end services.

## Monitoring and Analytics Service

This service monitors system health and performance, ensuring our services are always running at their best.

Our architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, utilizing cloud services, containerization, and real-time communication technologies. We're committed to providing a reliable, efficient service for all our users.
